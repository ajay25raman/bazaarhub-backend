# Seller Management Module (`com.bazaarhub.backend.seller`)

## 1. Module Overview
The Seller module governs vendor onboarding, KYC verification, legal entity documentation, tax information, and seller operational status.

This module is designed as an autonomous vertical slice of the BazaarHub Modular Monolith, strictly adhering to Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

---

## 2. Business Responsibilities
- Seller onboarding application and business registration
- Know Your Customer (KYC) documentation upload and verification
- Tax identifiers (GST/VAT, PAN) validation and status
- Bank account details verification for payouts
- Seller performance metrics, badges, and operational suspension/reactivation

---

## 3. Implementation Status & Roadmap

### Implemented Functionality (Phase 1 Foundation)
- [x] Clean Architecture folder hierarchy (`domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`, `presentation`).
- [x] Module boundary isolation within `com.bazaarhub.backend.seller`.
- [x] Layer package definitions and architectural contracts.
- [x] Unit and slice test package scaffolding under `src/test/java/com/bazaarhub/backend/seller`.

### Planned Functionality (Subsequent Phases)
- [ ] Multi-step vendor onboarding wizard backend
- [ ] Admin approval/rejection workflows with audit notes
- [ ] Automated document verification integration
- [ ] Seller SLA performance tracking

### Layer Rules
1. **Domain Layer**: Contains enterprise business rules. Has ZERO dependencies on Spring Framework, database drivers, or HTTP frameworks.
2. **Application Layer**: Coordinates use cases, transaction boundaries, and security rules. Depends solely on domain abstractions.
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements output ports defined by application/domain. Contains database entities, Spring Data repositories, and third-party adapters.
4. **Presentation Layer**: Thin REST controllers validating incoming HTTP payloads and delegating immediately to application input ports.

## 5. Module Dependencies & Communication Rules

### Dependencies
- **Shared Kernel**: `com.bazaarhub.backend.shared` (common domain exceptions, standardized API response wrapper, base value objects).
- **External Module Access**: References Identity userId. Interacts with Store and Finance modules. Depends on Shared kernel.

### Cross-Module Communication Rules
1. **No Shared Database Tables**: This module owns its data model exclusively. No other module may query this module's tables directly.
2. **Public Contracts Only**: Other modules must communicate strictly via public Application Input Ports or asynchronous Domain Events.
3. **No Circular Dependencies**: Circular dependencies between `seller` and other modules are strictly prohibited.
4. Provides SellerVerificationPort for Store activation. Finance module queries verified bank details for payouts.

---

## 6. Future Implementation Roadmap
1. Define domain entities, value objects, and domain events.
2. Implement application use cases and validation rules.
3. Add repository output ports and mock test doubles.
4. Expose REST endpoints with OpenAPI annotations and Spring Validation.
5. In Phase 2: Add database persistence entities, Flyway migrations, and repository adapters.
