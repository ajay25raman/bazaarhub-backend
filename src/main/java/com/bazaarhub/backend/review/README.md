# Review & Rating Module (`com.bazaarhub.backend.review`)

## 1. Module Overview
The Review module handles verified customer ratings, textual reviews, media uploads, moderation workflows, and score aggregation for products, stores, and delivery partners.

This module is designed as an autonomous vertical slice of the BazaarHub Modular Monolith, strictly adhering to Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

---

## 2. Business Responsibilities
- Product, store, and delivery partner reviews and 1-5 star ratings
- Verified purchaser verification against completed orders
- Customer photo and video media upload attachments
- Review moderation workflow (profanity filtering, reported reviews, admin approval)
- Rating aggregate calculations (average rating, rating distributions)

---

## 3. Implementation Status & Roadmap

### Implemented Functionality (Phase 1 Foundation)
- [x] Clean Architecture folder hierarchy (`domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`, `presentation`).
- [x] Module boundary isolation within `com.bazaarhub.backend.review`.
- [x] Layer package definitions and architectural contracts.
- [x] Unit and slice test package scaffolding under `src/test/java/com/bazaarhub/backend/review`.

### Planned Functionality (Subsequent Phases)
- [ ] Verified buyer validation port checking Order history
- [ ] Automated profanity filter and sentiment analysis hook
- [ ] Helpful/unhelpful community voting on reviews
- [ ] Seller official response mechanism

### Layer Rules
1. **Domain Layer**: Contains enterprise business rules. Has ZERO dependencies on Spring Framework, database drivers, or HTTP frameworks.
2. **Application Layer**: Coordinates use cases, transaction boundaries, and security rules. Depends solely on domain abstractions.
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements output ports defined by application/domain. Contains database entities, Spring Data repositories, and third-party adapters.
4. **Presentation Layer**: Thin REST controllers validating incoming HTTP payloads and delegating immediately to application input ports.

## 5. Module Dependencies & Communication Rules

### Dependencies
- **Shared Kernel**: `com.bazaarhub.backend.shared` (common domain exceptions, standardized API response wrapper, base value objects).
- **External Module Access**: Interacts with Customer, Order, Catalog, Store. Depends on Shared kernel.

### Cross-Module Communication Rules
1. **No Shared Database Tables**: This module owns its data model exclusively. No other module may query this module's tables directly.
2. **Public Contracts Only**: Other modules must communicate strictly via public Application Input Ports or asynchronous Domain Events.
3. **No Circular Dependencies**: Circular dependencies between `review` and other modules are strictly prohibited.
4. Queries Order to confirm delivered status; updates Catalog and Store aggregate rating projections.

---

## 6. Future Implementation Roadmap
1. Define domain entities, value objects, and domain events.
2. Implement application use cases and validation rules.
3. Add repository output ports and mock test doubles.
4. Expose REST endpoints with OpenAPI annotations and Spring Validation.
5. In Phase 2: Add database persistence entities, Flyway migrations, and repository adapters.
